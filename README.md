<!-- Assumption -  -->
- We are ignoring any duplicate values in qualcomm-test-words.txt file that means get_anagrams method will always return the list of unique words.
- Order of words in the returned list can vary.
- We are not considering case sensitivity
- If a word contains anything other than alphabets then we are throwing an error
- We are ignoring leading and trailing spaces.
